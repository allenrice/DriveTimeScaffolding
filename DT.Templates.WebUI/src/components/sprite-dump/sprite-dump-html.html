            These sprites are generated by Gulp on build via the 'sprite' build task.  Inspect the elements to see how to add them to your pages.  You can have as many sprite sets as you want by modifying the number of folders in /src/sprites.  You just have to manually include the css file generated for these sprites in the /Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml file <br /><br /><b>Note:</b> As you add sprites and add images to sprites, they will automatically appear on this page because it is generated based on the classnames used
