            These glyphs are generated by Gulp on build via the 'glyphs' build task.  Inspect the elements to see how to add them to your pages.  You can have as many glyph font files as you want by modifying the number of folders in /src/sprites.  You just have to manually include the css file generated for these glyphs in the /Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml file <br /><br /><b>Note:</b> As you add glyph fonts and add icons to glyph fonts, they will automatically appear on this page because it is generated based on the classnames used
